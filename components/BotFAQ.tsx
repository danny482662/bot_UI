      <p>
        Yes, the bot is indeed connected to your Binance account. That&apos;s done through the API_KEY/API_SECRET you need to provide. 
        Read next question to learn how to obtain them ðŸ‘‡

    question: "How to get the API_KEY & API_SECRET required to run the bot?",

      <p>
        Simply click on the &apos;Get API Key & Secret&apos; button at the top. 
        You will find a detailed documentation by Binance on how to get them from their portal!

    question: "With which cryptos does the bot perform the best?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        The bot is designed to work best with the bigger crypto pairs like BTCUSDT / ETHUSDT / SOLUSDT / MATICUSDT on the SPOT market! 
        Using the bot for trading meme and lower cap coins is risky and should be done with a lot of cautions as the strategy was designed for bigger coins!
        Of course, more risk = bigger wins, but also more risk = bigger loses!
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Is the bot working with leverage?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        No, the bot is designed and confgiured to run on the SPOT Crypto Market only, at the moment! 
        We are working on different bots for the Futures Crypto Market!
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a Binance Account to use the bot?",
    answer: 
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        Yes, you do need a Binance trading account! The bot is configured to work only with the Binance Exchange. 
      </div>,
  },
  {
    question: "Is the trading bot running even when I am offline?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes! The bot will run until you stop it via clicking on the `Stop` button, no matter on or off line!
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit on how much $ I can put in?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        No, but since we are trading, put in as much as you&apos;re willing to lose! Although algorithmic, there is a risk of losing money!
      </p>
